DESCRIPTION					*push*

This plugin eases the pain when putting yanked or deleted text that includes
whitespace on the "wrong" side.

It introduces mappings to perform a "push", which is the same as |put|, but
shifts text contents in the register past any included whitespace to one side.

[=p			Put text after the cursor [count] times, shifting
			register text leftwards and up.

[=P			Put text before the cursor [count] times, shifting
			register text leftwards and up.

]=p			Put text after the cursor [count] times, shifting
			register text rightwards and down.

]=P			Put text before the cursor [count] times, shifting
			register text rightwards and down.

See the plugin script for corresponding |<Plug>| mappings.
